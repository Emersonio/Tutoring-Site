      Hi! My name is Emerson and I love math. 
      I am excited to be offering a one-on-one virtual math tutoring service!
      Please feel free to reach out over DMs if you or someone you know might be interested. 
      I have a degree in applied math and I can assist with any math topic from k-12 and even college levels. 
      I believe that one-on-one instruction with a teacher who cares is the best way to improve at math. 
      I’m very passionate about math and I hope to help others see the beauty in my favorite subject.
